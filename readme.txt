ACF Theme Code will automatically generate the code needed to implement Advanced Custom Fields in your themes!

== Description ==
ACF Theme Code is an extension for the awesome [Advanced Custom Fields](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) plugin.

We've created this plugin to save developers time when it comes to implementing Advanced Custom Fields in their WordPress themes.

= Existing / common ACF workflow: =

1. Create Field Group
2. Search ACF documentation for how to implement a particular field type and it's settings (return values etc)
3. Copy example code from ACF documentation and paste it into your theme or plugin
4. Go through and customise all the field names in the example code

= New / improved workflow with ACF Theme Code: =

1. Create Field Group
2. Use clipboard icon to copy and paste a field's already customised code into your theme

No more constantly referring to the ACF documentation to see how to implement a particular field. No more customising field names in code examples.
